# VirtuC - A 16-bit Virtual Machine in C  

**VirtuC** is a lightweight 16-bit virtual machine (VM) written from scratch in C. Designed for simplicity and educational purposes, this VM emulates a custom 16-bit architecture with a minimal instruction set, memory management, and basic I/O capabilities.  

## Features  
- **16-bit CPU Emulation**: Supports registers, stack operations, and a custom instruction set.  
- **Modular Design**: Easily extensible architecture for adding new instructions or hardware emulation.  
- **Memory Management**: 64KB addressable memory with read/write operations.  
- **Basic I/O**: Simple input/output handling for interactive programs.  
- **Debugging Support**: Includes logging and step-by-step execution for troubleshooting.  

## Use Cases  
- Learn how virtual machines and emulators work.  
- Experiment with low-level programming and instruction sets.  
- Build a foundation for more complex VM-based projects.
